# Traffic-Light-Simulation

The purpose of this program was simulate an imagined traffic light as outlined in the project document. We then output the overheard view of what the intesection looked like second by second. For further information about the intersection please see the project document.

To open this file use the Makefile by calling "make" and then "Driver.out input.txt" .

Otherwise you can open in Visual Studio, be sure to add input.txt to your debug arguments!
